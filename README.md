ER Diagram
======================

Uses Java (JDBC, Spring, and Jackson) to generate a JSON file, then uses JS (backbone.js, bootstrap, lodash, bootstrap-notify and vis.js) to draw ER Diagram from the JSON file. By default, this uses the Oracle Driver, but you can change to other drivers as you wish and it will auto generate the proper diagram for you.

This is a useful to understand how the tables are related and find their data types.

To run, just call "jetty_debug.bat".

Have fun!
