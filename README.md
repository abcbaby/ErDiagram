ER Diagram
======================



Uses Java (JDBC, Spring, and Jackson) to generate a JSON file, then uses JS (backbone.js, bootstrap, lodash, and vis.js) to draw ER Diagram. By default, this uses the Oracle Driver, but you can change to other drivers as you wish and it will auto generate the proper diagram for you.

This is a useful to understand how the tables are related and find their data types.

To run, just call "jetty_debug.bat".

Have fun!
